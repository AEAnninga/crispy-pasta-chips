5. In a _large dry non-stick pan_, heat the sesame seeds over a _medium heat for 3-4 minutes_ until they start to brown and pop, while stirring regularly, taking care not to burn.   
  Now crush the sesame seeds along with the salt or garlic salt , you can do this in a pestle & mortar if you have one or just pop the seeds into a ziploc bag and bash a few times with a rolling pin or a mug until the seeds look more like a powder.   
  Mix with the remaining spice mix ingredients
6. To make the red pepper dip, add the soaked softened cashews and all the other dip ingredients to a blender with the 100ml ml of fresh water and remaining dip ingredients. Blend until very smooth.
